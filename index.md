Open Source UK Energy Data (OSUKED) provides a combination of API wrappers, git-scrapers and general Python tools for processing data from the UK energy sector. As an Open Source project we welcome and encourage users to contribute to this knowledge-base, more information can be found [here](https://github.com/OSUKED).

Our [sister site](https://osenergynews.co.uk/), which collates the latest energy news, is powered by the energy news git-scraper from OSUKED.
